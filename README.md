# talktpdf
How It Works (The Gist)
Upload: You pick a PDF file.
Process: The app reads the text from your PDF.
Embed & Store: It then breaks this text into smaller pieces and uses a Google AI model to turn these pieces into embeddings. These embeddings are stored in a local FAISS vector store, which is like a super-efficient index for your PDF's content. This happens once per PDF.
Ask: You type in a question.
Search & Answer: The app searches the vector store for the most relevant text chunks from your PDF related to your question. These chunks, along with your question, are then sent to the Gemini chat model, which generates an answer.
